My name is <b>Timothy Cole</b> or as my parents refer to me, tech support but you can call me <b>Tim</b>!<br><br>
I'm a <b>20 year old</b>, self-taught, full-stack web developer living on the coastal side of <b>North Carolina</b>.<br><br>
When I was 10 years old I fell in love with computers. I thought they were so neat that I wanted to become the CEO of Intel one day! When I was 13 I realized how intriguing websites are so I started to tinker with inspect element. It wasn't until then when I realized what I wanted to do with my life. A few months passed and I was still learning and investing my time away.<br><br>
<i>EUREKA!</i> - Finally, by the age of 14, I created my very first website! All front-end and far from perfect, but it was mine that's all that mattered. As time passed, I completed many projects, gradually becoming more educated and working harder as ever.<br><br>
After hating school for my entire life, when I was 17 in freshmen year, I decided to drop out to pursue my career as a web developer.<br><br>
Now I'm fluent in CSS, HTML, JS, NodeJS, PHP and Java (Android Development) with a touch of Python, currently working as QA and Development at <a href="http://socialblade.com/info/team" target="_blank">SocialBlade</a>.
